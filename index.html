            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Mohith, currently in my third year of pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at KLU. My enthusiasm for technology and innovation drives my dedication to mastering web development and software engineering. Through various projects and internships over the past few years, I've built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern web technologies.</p>
            <p>I have a keen interest in developing user-friendly and responsive web applications that address real-world challenges. My coursework and practical projects have given me a comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle, from initial design to final deployment. I excel in collaborative settings and enjoy working with teams to bring creative solutions to life.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, participating in hackathons, and contributing to open-source projects. I am always eager to learn and embrace new challenges that expand my knowledge and skills.</p>
